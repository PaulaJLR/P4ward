# P4ward - Predictive Python Protacs Pipeline: workflow automation for research and development.

P4ward is a fully automated, customizable and open-source program for Protacs ternary complex modelling. P4ward takes two binary complexes, as well as a list of Protac 2D structures, and models ternary complexes for each of the protacs. P4ward also generates summary tables with all relevand modelling information, as well as interactive plots.

P4ward is written in Python3 and integrates free and open-source structural biology tools, such as Megadock, RxDock, and libraries such as RDkit and BioPython to build a workflow with no accessibility barriers. As such, we acknowledge the countless contributors to open-source code which enables research by all and for all (Please view [this section](LINK) for attribution and licenses).
