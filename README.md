# P4ward - Predictive Python Protacs Pipeline: workflow automation for research and development.

P4ward is a fully automated, customizable and open-source program for Protacs ternary complex modelling. From two known binary complexes and a list of Protac 2D conformations, it can predict ternary complexes for each protac listed.

P4ward is written in Python3 and integrates permissively licensed structural biology tools, such as Megadock, RxDock, and libraries such as RDkit and BioPython to build a workflow with no accessibility barriers. As such, we acknowledge the countless contributors to open-source code which enables research by all and for all.
